# RideOrDrive

For our Software Engineering and Design Lab, we decided to make a web app that allows individuals to decide whether it would be better for them to drive to a certain location or to take an Uber. We aggregated Uber/Lyft prices, parking information, and extra useful information such as the weather with a beautiful UI.

Some of the features that we added include:
- Login with history
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Google's Geocoding, Geocaching, Maps APIs
- Web scraper which collects parking and weather information
